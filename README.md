>  A retrospective board is used within the Scrum workflow. Scrum is the most popular Agile style of software project management used to guide the software development life cycle. Scrum style management is based on four basic ceremonies for each sprint or software release: the 1.) Sprint Planning meeting, 2.) Daily Stand-up, 3.) Sprint Review, and 4.) Sprint Retrospective.
